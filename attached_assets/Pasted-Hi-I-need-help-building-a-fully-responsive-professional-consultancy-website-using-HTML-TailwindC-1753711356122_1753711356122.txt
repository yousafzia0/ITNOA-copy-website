Hi, I need help building a fully responsive, professional consultancy website using HTML + TailwindCSS (and JavaScript only if necessary).

🔗 Reference Website
Use this website as a reference for content (services and industries) and page structure, but design it with a light, modern aesthetic that feels trustworthy, tech-focused, and professional:

👉 https://jeed.top/itnoa/

🎨 Design Style & Direction
Theme: Clean, light-themed, modern — a hybrid of cybersecurity consultancy and subtle Pakistani/Islamic inspiration

Primary color: Dark green #01411c (Pakistan green)

Fonts: Use Inter, Poppins, or optionally Cairo

Layout: Responsive and mobile-first

Backgrounds: Light colors (white, soft gray), with optional geometric/Islamic patterns in section backgrounds

Effects: Use elegant animations and hover transitions to make it feel modern and interactive (scroll reveal, hover glows, card flip, etc.)

Stack: Use TailwindCSS utility classes only — no Bootstrap or external frameworks

📄 Pages to Include
Please build the following pages:

1. 🏠 Home
Hero section: Bold heading, subtext, CTA button

Teaser section with 3–4 service highlights

Light background with green accents

Optional animated section dividers or scroll-in effects

2. 🛠 Services
Extract all services from the reference site → https://jeed.top/itnoa/

Display services in responsive cards or tiles

Also include my client’s priority services:

IT Audit

Information Security (GRC) Consulting

Business Continuity / Cyber Resilience

Each service card should include a short description and animation/hover effect

3. 🏭 Industries
Pull all industry types from the reference site

Display them in a grid or carousel

Include a brief description for each industry and a relevant icon or placeholder image

Make this section visually engaging with animations

4. 🤝 Become a Client
Call-to-action page with persuasive copy

Clean contact form: Name, Email, Organization, Message

CTA button

Light, clean design with animations

5. 📞 Contact
Display updated contact information

Contact form (validated)

Optional embedded Google Map or location icon

Secure layout with responsive design

🦾 Footer

Social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, Matrix)

Optional: Light Islamic geometric background pattern (low-opacity)

Match overall color scheme and use green accent
